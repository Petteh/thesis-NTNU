\chapter{Requirements}
%\label{chap:requirements}

The requirements chapter should lead up to a concrete descrip- tion of both the functional and non-functional requirements for whatever is to be developed at both a high level (use cases) and lower levels (low level use cases, requirements). If a classical waterfall development process is fol- lowed, this chapter is the product of the requirement phase. If a more agile model like, e.g., SCRUM is followed, the requirements will appear through the project as, e.g., the user stories developed in the sprint planning meet- ings.
